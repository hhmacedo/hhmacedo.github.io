::: {.introduction}
Hello, my name is Hugo, and I am a researcher at the [Institute for Applied Economic Research](https://www.ipea.gov.br), where I primarily work on the [Atlas of the Brazilian State](https://www.ipea.gov.br/atlasestado). My main interests include social inequality and enhancing access to data, and I believe that science evolves through transparency. Therefore, you can expect to see me promoting and engaging with open-source and open access initiatives.
